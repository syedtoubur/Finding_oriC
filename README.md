# ðŸ”¬ oriC Prediction Pipeline

This project provides an efficient and partially biologically informed pipeline to predict the **origin of replication (oriC)** in bacterial genomes using patterns like **DnaA boxes**, **AT-rich regions**, **GATC motifs**, and **GC skew analysis**.

## ðŸš€ Features

âœ… GC Skew Analysis

Calculates GC skew and identifies minima or local dips in skew values to narrow down potential oriC regions.

âœ… K-mer Pattern Discovery

Scans for the most frequently repeated k-mers (e.g., 9-mers) and their reverse complements, allowing Hamming distance-based mismatches.

Focuses on repeats clustered within a defined window size (e.g., 500 bp).

âœ… Poly-AT Region Detection

Identifies AT-rich sequences, which are often essential for strand separation during replication initiation.

âœ… Refined OriC Selection

Integrates k-mer repeat positions and AT-rich regions to predict a concise oriC region.

Handles circular genome context by considering flanking sequence continuity.

âœ… Optional Enhancements

Detection of GATC clusters for SeqA protein binding.

Identification of other replication-related motifs (e.g., IHF sites, DnaA-trios) for further biological insights.
